# Description
Boston Home Page is a static website that I created to strengthen my HTML and CSS skills. 

## How its Made
This project involved the use of HTML and CSS. I made great use of floats when positioning elements on this page. During this project I also got to take advantage of fontawesome's free icons. Manipulating margin and padding played a large role in producing the finished product. 


## What I Learned
Emulating this website was great for practicing positioning sections and unordered lists. My favorite part of this project was finding pictures to counter ballance the amount of white space present on the page. Spacing the unordered list items so that they were visually pleasing was a bit tricky but in the end prper targeting in my code resolved this issue. The same applied to getting certain headers to be the same color and size.
